## Dataset used- 
- <a href="https://github.com/Kaur-Ramneet/Netflix_userbase_analysis/blob/main/Netflix%20Userbase%20(1).csv">Dataset</a>
## Project insights
- The highest number of users are located in the United States and Spain, indicating strong market presence in these regions, with a higher proportion of female users and more access 
  via laptops and tablets. 
- The most commonly selected subscription type among users is the Basic plan. 
- Most Netflix users fall within the age group above 26 years. 
- The highest average Lifetime Value (LTV) per user is observed in the United Kingdom and France. However, the highest total LTV (i.e., the sum of LTV across all users) comes from the 
  United States and Spain.
## Recommendation
Targeted marketing campaigns focus on countries with highest LTV such as United States  and Spain for premium content and promotion. We have seen that avg LTV is much high in France and UK so it's another market we should pay attention to create some special marketing campaigns to acquire more customers in France .
